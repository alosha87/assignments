#CSS flexbox

- Can be used on a container element (an element with other elements directly nested inside of it)
- The flex relationship is parent to direct child, so only direct children are affected by the flexbox.
- Flex box has 2 main axis, one that goes left to right and the other goes top to bottom.
    - The default axis is flex-direction: row;


#flex-direction: row (default):
    - justify-content: left to right
    - align-items: top to bottom
    
#flex-direction: column
    - justify-content: top to bottom
    - align-items: left to right
