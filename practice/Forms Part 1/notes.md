The standard way to take user input using HTML and Javascript is by using the input HTML element.  
The HTML form element can be wrapped around a group of inputs to create a form the user can type in and submit, such as a login or signup form on a website.

The "submit" event is used on forms as it allows the user to either click the submit button or press "enter" to submit the information.

Submit events refresh the website by default, so this needs to prevented as soon as the submit event occurs to maintain the information.
